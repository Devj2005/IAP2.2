File Explanations for Gaming Hub Project

This document explains the purpose of each main file in your project and how the email verification process works.

1. Layouts/Layouts.php
- Handles the overall look and structure of every page (header, navbar, banner, content, footer).
- Uses Bootstrap and FontAwesome for modern design and icons.
- The banner section is customizable and includes a call-to-action button.

2. Forms/Forms.php
- Contains the code for the signup and signin forms.
- Each form is styled and collects user input (name, email, password).
- The forms use POST method to send data to the server for processing.

3. signup.php
- Displays the signup form and processes user registration.
- Validates user input and stores new users in the database (`users` table).
- Generates a unique verification token for each user and saves it in the database.
- Sends a verification email to the user with a special link to verify their account.
- The verification link looks like: `http://localhost/IAP2.2/verify.php?token=...`
- Shows a popup message when the verification email is sent.

4. signin.php
- Displays the signin form and processes user login.
- Checks user credentials and ensures the account is verified before allowing access.
- Redirects the user to the dashboard if login is successful.

5. dashboard.php
- Shows a simple dashboard page after the user signs in.
- Displays gaming-related info and sections (profile, latest game, community stats).

6. Global/SendMail.php
- Contains the code for sending emails using PHPMailer.
- Used by signup.php to send the verification email.
- The email body includes the verification link for the user to click.

7. verify.php
- Handles account verification when the user clicks the link in their email.
- Checks the token in the URL, marks the user as verified in the database, and shows a confirmation message.
- If the token is invalid or already used, shows an appropriate message.

8. conf.php
- Stores configuration settings for the site (site name, database credentials, email settings, etc.).
- Used by other files to access these settings.

Where is the verify part in the email?
- In signup.php, after a user registers, a unique token is generated and stored in the database.
- The verification email is sent using SendMail.php, and the body of the email contains a link:
  `http://localhost/IAP2.2/verify.php?token=...`
- When the user clicks this link, verify.php checks the token and verifies the account.

Summary:
- Each file has a clear role: layout, forms, registration, login, dashboard, email sending, verification, and configuration.
- The verification process is secure and ensures only users who click the email link can activate their account.
